## Overview
###
Tarot is a static comp of a website for getting tarot readings.

## Project Status
###
This project would require quite a bit more development to be a functioning website, but as a static comp it's complete. It was designed based on a provided static comp, with some creative license allowed (see directly below).

## Using the Site:
###
Since this is only a static comp, I've included a broad imaginative explanation of how the site would function.
* The top right drop down allows users to select which spread they'd like to use to recieve their reading.
* The "Reading" section will provide a randomized selection of cards with brief descriptions in whatever layout the user selects.
* Users can click on individual cards to see a pop-up of that card and more information, or go to the "Dictionary" page to find meanings for cards on there own.
* And what's a good website without e-commerce? So I've included a "shop" page as well.
## Reflection:
###
Tarot was completed as an individual static comp project for the Turing School of Software and Design. It was used to self-teach and practice HTML layout design, particularly through flexbox and grid.  

Learning the idiosyncrasies of these tools required a lot of individual research; for example I would not have successfully created this layout without discovering the use of `div:nth-child(n)` to create overlapping elements within a grid. Also I learned that cross-browser compatibility should be considered very early on in the project. I found that each browser had slightly different styling and slightly different understandings of the units of measurement I was using.
### Future Goals
I'd like to get a lot more comfortable with CSS, and particularly I'd like to find good ways to keep it organized in large projects.
### In Closing
I've always thought of HTML and CSS as finicky languages, and although I still probably do, finishing this project has helped me to get more excited about learning and using more of them in the future.
